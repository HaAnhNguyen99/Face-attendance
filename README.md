## Introduction

The Face Recognition Attendance System is designed to automate the process of recording attendance. It utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces from a live video feed or a set of images, logging attendance details with timestamps in a CSV file.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Uses Haar cascades and deep learning models for accurate face detection.
- **Face Recognition:** Trains a model using student images to identify individuals.
- **Attendance Logging:** Automatically records attendance with timestamps in a CSV file.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** User-friendly interface developed using Tkinter.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas.
- **Tools:** Tkinter
- **Database:** Sqlite

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/face-attendance-system.git](https://github.com/HaAnhNguyen99/Face-attendance.git)
   cd face-attendance-system
